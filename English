Esperanto Discord Server Rules:

• Rule #1: Be respectful to other users. That includes not being too rude to others through insults or bullying, using preferred pronouns, etc. Admins seek to be inclusive of all opinions, but some are not respectable, such as evident and virulent racism, transphobia, fascism, etc.
• Rule #2: Use the proper channels! For example, speak Esperanto in the Esperanto channels, discuss a given topic in the most appropriate channel, etc. Check the channel descriptions for guidance on what is allowed. You may continue off-topic discussions in Discord threads.
• Rule #3: Don’t spam.
• Rule #4: Respect what the admins have to say. Usually we're just trying to clarify the rules and help guide conversations politely.
• Rule #5: Don’t break the rules “as a joke”, that’s still breaking the rules.
• Rule #6: Respect Discord’s guidelines.
• Rule #7: Try to set a good example for beginners, and try to be clear in your messages. If users find your writing too incomprehensible because of reforms, poeticism, or wordplay, we may ask you to limit such writing to suitable channels.

Possible punishments: removal of offending messages, temporary mute, restricted access to certain channels, ban. You're always welcome to appeal a ban. The admin team is inclined to offer the benefit of the doubt, and to interpret the rules less according to the "letter of the law", more to the "spirit of the law". Contact an admin privately if you have any concerns, requests, or questions!
